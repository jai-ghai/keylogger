# keylogger
The Keylogger Project is a small-scale software project designed to facilitate the identification and testing of keyboard keys. The primary objective of this project is to develop a keylogger tool that records and analyzes keystrokes, providing valuable insights into keyboard behavior and assisting in the testing and evaluation of keyboards.
